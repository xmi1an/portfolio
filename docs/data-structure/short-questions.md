    Data is collection of facts, figures and numbers. Data is raw material.

#### 2. What is Information?

    Meaningful data or processing data is called information.

#### 3. What is Data Structure?

    A Data Structure is an arrangement of data in a computer memory or sometimes on a disk.

#### 4. List out types of data structure.

    1. Primitive Data Structure
    2. Non-Primitive Data Structure

#### 5) List out types Non-Primitive data structure.

    1. Linear Data Structure
    2. Non-Linear Data Structure

#### 6) What is primitive data structure?

    A data can be work within a computer is known as primitive data structure.

#### 7) What is Non-Primitive data structure?

    A Data Structure that makes use of computed address to locate its element is called non-primitive data structure.

#### 8. What is Linear data structure?

    A list which displays the relationship between its elements is called linear data structure.

#### 9. What is Non-Linear data structure?

    A list which display there is no relationship between two elements addresses is called non-linear list.

#### 10. What is Algorithm?

    A Step-by-step method of solving a problem is called algorithm.

#### 11. What is String?

    Any sequence or set of characters defined within double quotation symbols is a string.

#### 1. What is Array?

    Array is a series of finite number of elements of same data type placed
    simultaneously in memory that can be individually referenced using index and a unique name.

#### 2. List out characteristics of an array.

    1. Size
    2. Type
    3. Index

#### 3. What is stack?

    Stack is a type of linear data structure. Stack is operated with First In Last Out (FILO) or Last In First Out (LIFO).

#### 4. Stack is operated with \_\_\_\_ .

    Stack is operated with First In Last Out (FILO) or Last In First Out (LIFO).

#### 5. Write down real life example of stack.

    Real life example of stack is Arrangement of Tray in Tray Bucket.

#### 6. List out operations perform on stack.

    1. Push
    2. Pop
    3. Peek
    4. Length
    5. Display

#### 7. What is the overflow condition of PUSH in stack.

    If top > = size
    Then
    Write “Stack is Overflow”

#### 8) What is the underflow condition of POP in stack.

    If tos=0
    Then
    Write “Stack is Underflow”

#### 9) What is static implementation of a stack?

    If the stack is implemented using array then it is called Static implementation

#### 10) What is dynamic implementation of a stack?

    If the stack is implemented using linked list then it is called dynamic
    implementation.

#### 11) What is prefix notation?

    In prefix notation the sub-expression has the form of
    Operator     Operand    Operand

#### 12) What is postfix notation?

    In postfix notation the sub-expression has the form of
    Operand     Operand      Operator

#### 13) What is infix notation?

    In postfix notation the sub-expression has the form of
    Operand      Operator       Operand

#### 14) What is Queue?

    Queue is a linear type of data structure. Queue is operated with First In First Out (FIFO).

#### 15) Queue is operated with**\_**.

    Queue is operated with First In First Out (FIFO).

#### 16) Write down real life example of Queue.

    Number of students standing in a queue for collecting a pass from pass window.

#### 17) List out types of queue.

    1. Singly Queue
    2. Circular Queue
    3. Double Ended Queue
    4. Priority Queue

#### 18. What is the overflow condition in singly queue?

    If Rear>=SIZE
    Then
    Write “Queue is Overflow”
    and Exit

#### 19) What is the underflow condition in singly queue?

    If Front==0
    Then
    Write “Queue is Underflow”
    and Exit

#### 20) What is the main difference between singly queue and circular queue?

    In singly queue we can’t re-insert element in singly queue after delete element from the singly queue. But in circular queue we can re-insert element in circular queue after delete element from the circular queue.

#### 21. Write down real life example of circular queue.

    Real life example of circular queue is Merry-go-round.

#### 22) What is double ended queue?

    A Double Ended Queue is a linear list in which insertion and deletion of an element is done by end of the structure.

#### 23) Write down two variation of DEQueue.

    1. Input Restricted DEQueue
    2. Output Restricted DEQueue

#### 24) What is the main different between circular queue and double ended queue?

    In Circular queue we can insert or delete element from one side. But in double ended queue we can insert or delete element from both the side.

#### 25) What is priority queue?

    A priority queue is a queue in which each element is assigned a priority and elements are processed according to priority.

#### 26) What is Linked List?

    Linked list is a linear list.
    In a linked list there are two parts:

    - Data
    - Link

#### 27) In a link part we store the \_\_\_\_.

    In a link part we store the memory address of next node.

#### 28) With the help of NULL in a link part, we say that \_\_\_.

    With the help of NULL in a link part we say it is a last node of any link list application.

#### 29) List out types of Linked List.

1.  Singly Linked List.
1.  Doubly Linked List.
1.  Circular Linked List.

#### 30) Which function is used for memory allocation of node? And write down syntax of that function.

    malloc is used for memory allocation of node.
    Syntax :-

    Structure Variable Name=(struct structure-name *)malloc(sizeof(struct structure-name));

#### 31. What is Circular Linked List?

    A list in which the NULL pointer in the last node is replacing with the address of first node is known as circular linked list.

#### 32. What is the main different between Singly Linked List and Circular Linked List?

    In singly linked list we can’t access the previous node from the current node. But in circular linked list we can access the previous node from the current node using forward direction.

#### 33. What is doubly linked list?

#### 34. Write down name of links of the node in doubly linked list.

#### 35. List out application of doubly linked list.

#### 36. What is Sparse Matrix?

#### 37. What is Multi-Linked Structure?
